# Basic Node / Express / Angular app scaffold

Things to do before starting:

- Add API keys to .env
- Give yourself a hug

# To Set Up

- Clone the repo
- run `npm install` and `bower install`
- run `gulp`

# In Gulp:

- Main Bower Files grabs, compiles and minifies main files from each Bower component to `/public/js/lib.min.js`
- Browsersync runs your project and injects CSS, reloading page on JS and Jade View changes

# Disclaimer:

I may have inadvertently left some personal-code bits and pieces in this repo, delete at your leisure.
